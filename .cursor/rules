# GenX_FX Cursor AI Rules and Guidelines

## Project Context
This is a GenX_FX trading system project focused on:
- AI-powered foreign exchange trading
- Real-time market analysis
- Automated trading strategies
- Risk management systems
- Multi-platform integration

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use Python 3.11+ features when appropriate
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Write comprehensive docstrings for classes and functions
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Architecture Patterns
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic models for data structures
- Implement proper configuration management

## Trading System Specific Rules
- Always include proper risk management
- Validate all trading parameters before execution
- Log all trading decisions and outcomes
- Implement circuit breakers for safety
- Use proper decimal precision for financial calculations

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain high test coverage

## Security Considerations
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure communication protocols

## AI Integration Best Practices
- Implement proper model validation
- Use appropriate confidence thresholds
- Include model versioning and rollback capabilities
- Monitor model performance metrics
- Implement A/B testing for model improvements

## Database Guidelines
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- Implement proper migrations with Alembic
- Use connection pooling for performance
- Implement proper indexing strategies
- Handle database transactions properly

## API Development
- Follow RESTful API principles
- Use FastAPI for high performance
- Implement proper request/response validation
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include comprehensive API documentation

## Documentation
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Include setup and deployment instructions
- Provide code examples for key features
- Maintain changelog for releases

## Performance Optimization
- Use caching where appropriate
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Monitor and optimize database queries
- Use async operations for I/O bound tasks
- Profile code for performance bottlenecks

## Error Handling
- Use specific exception types
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle graceful degradation

## When suggesting code changes:
1. Explain the reasoning behind the change
2. Consider the impact on the overall system
3. Suggest improvements for maintainability
4. Include relevant tests when appropriate
5. Consider security implications
6. Think about scalability and performance
